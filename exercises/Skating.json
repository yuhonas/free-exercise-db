    "Roller skating is a fun activity which can be effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular endurance. It requires relatively good balance and coordination. It is necessary to learn the basics of skating including turning and stopping and to wear protective gear to avoid possible injury.",
    "You can skate at a comfortable pace for 30 minutes straight. If you want a cardio challenge, do interval skating â€“ speed skate two minutes of every five minutes, using the remaining three minutes to recover. A 150 lb person will typically burn about 175 calories in 30 minutes skating at a comfortable pace, similar to brisk walking."
