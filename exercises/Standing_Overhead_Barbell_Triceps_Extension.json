    "Keeping your upper arms close to your head and elbows in, perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.",
    "Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the barbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.",
