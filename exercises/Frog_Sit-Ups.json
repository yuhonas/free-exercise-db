    "Lie with your back flat on the floor (or exercise mat) and your legs extended in front of you.",
    "Now bend at the knees and place your outer thighs by the floor (or mat) as you make the soles of your feet touch each other.",
    "Now try pushing both soles and bringing them up as near you as possible while you keep the outer thighs on the floor (or at least almost touching it). Tip: In this position your legs should create a diamond shape.",
    "Now, cross your arms in front of you by touching the opposite shoulders. This will be your starting position.",
    "As you exhale flatten your lower back to the floor while curling the torso upwards. Tip: This will be like performing the first 1/4 movement of a sit up. Hold at the top position for a second.",
    "As you inhale, slowly lower back to the starting position.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
