    "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.",
    "Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.",
    "Step away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: Do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. li>",
    "Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.",
    "Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg."
