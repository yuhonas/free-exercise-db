    "Place a flat bench in front of a high pulley or lat pulldown machine.",
    "Hold the straight bar attachment using an underhand grip (palms up) that is about shoulder width.",
    "Lie on your back with your head over the end of the bench.",
    "Now extend your arms straight above your shoulders. Your torso and your arms should make a 90-degree angle and the elbows should be in. This will be your starting position.",
    "As you breathe out, curl the bar down in a semicircular motion until it touches your chin. Squeeze the biceps for a second at the top contracted position. Tip: As you execute this motion only the forearms should move. At no time should the upper arms be moving at all. They are to remain perpendicular throughout the movement.",
    "Return to starting position slowly.",
    "Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."
